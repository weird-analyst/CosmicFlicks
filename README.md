# CosmicFlicks
Movie Recommendation Web Application

## Overview
Dive into the world of personalized movie recommendations with CosmicFlicks. This project harnesses the power of the TMDB 5000 movies database to curate tailored movie suggestions just for you. Using an out-of-bag model for tag vectorization and the magic of cosine similarity, we bring you a simple yet effective movie recommendation system.

## Project Structure
- `Movie Recommendation System.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing everything.
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: Dataset 1.
- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: Dataset 2.
- `main.py`: Streamlit Web Application.

## Usage
Run through the .ipynb notebook once before running the web application since it creates some files required for the main.py to run.
